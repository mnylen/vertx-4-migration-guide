= Changes in {VertX} JDBC client

From {VertX} {v4}, the JDBC client supports SQL client. The SQL common module has also been merged in JDBC client, that is, `io.vertx:vertx-sql-common` merged in `io.vertx:vertx-jdbc-client` module. You will have to remove the `io.vertx:vertx-sql-common` dependency file because `io.vertx:vertx-jdbc-client` will include it. With the merging of SQL common client, all the database APIs have been consolidated into the JDBC client.

In {VertX} {v4}, the SQL client has been updated to include the following clients:

* Reactive PostgreSQL client. In earlier releases, it included a reactive PostgreSQL client.

* Reactive MySQL client
* Reactive DB2 client
* Continues to include reactive PostgreSQL client. This client was available in {VertX} {v3x} releases as well.
* Existing JDBC client now includes both the JDBC client API and the SQL client API

The reactive implementations use the database network protocols. This makes them resource-efficient.

JDBC calls to database are blocking calls. The JDBC client uses worker threads to make these calls non-blocking.

The following section describes the changes in {VertX} JDBC client.

== Creating a pool

In {VertX} {v4}, you can create a pool using the JDBC client APIs. In earlier releases, you could create only clients. You could not create pools.

The following example shows how to create a client in {VertX} {v3x}.

[source,java]
----
// 3.x
SQLClient client = JDBCClient.create(vertx, jsonConfig);
----

The following example shows how to create a pool in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
// 4.x
JDBCPool pool = JDBCPool.pool(vertx, jsonConfig);
----

NOTE: Though the {VertX} {v3x} APIs are supported in {VertX} {v4}, it is recommended that you use the new JDBC client APIs in your applications.

A pool enables you to perform simple queries. You do not need to manage connections for simple queries. However, for complex queries or multiple queries, you must manage your connections.

The following example shows how to manage connections for queries in {VertX} {v3x}.

[source,java]
----
// 3.x
client.getConnection(res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    SQLConnection connection = res.result();
    // Important, do not forget to return the connection
    connection.close();
  } else {
    // Failed to get connection
  }
});
----

The following example shows how to manage connections for queries in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
// 4.x
pool
  .getConnection()
  .onFailure(e -> {
    // Failed to get a connection
  })
  .onSuccess(conn -> {
    // Important, do not forget to return the connection
    conn.close();
  });
----

== Support for Typsesafe Config

You can use `jsonConfig` for configurations. However, using the `jsonConfig` may sometimes result in errors. To avoid these errors, the JDBC client introduces Typesafe Config.

The following example shows the basic structure of a Typesafe Config.

[source,java]
----
// 4.x ONLY!!!
JDBCPool pool = JDBCPool.pool(
      vertx,
      // configure the connection
      new JDBCConnectOptions()
        // H2 connection string
        .setJdbcUrl("jdbc:h2:~/test")
        // username
        .setUser("sa")
        // password
        .setPassword(""),
      // configure the pool
      new PoolOptions()
        .setMaxSize(16)
    );
----

NOTE: To use Typesafe Config, you must include the `agroal` connection pool in your project. The pool does not expose many configuration options and makes the configuration easy to use.

== Running SQL queries

This section shows you how to run queries in the JDBC client.

=== Running one shot queries

The following example shows how to run queries without managing the connection in {VertX} {v3x}.

[source,java]
----
// 3.x
client.query("SELECT * FROM user WHERE emp_id > ?", new JsonArray().add(1000), res -> {
  if (res.succeeded()) {
    ResultSet rs = res2.result();
    // You can use these results in your application
  }
});
----

The following example shows how to run queries without managing the connection in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
// 4.x
pool
  .preparedQuery("SELECT * FROM user WHERE emp_id > ?")
  // the emp id to look up
  .execute(Tuple.of(1000))
  .onSuccess(rows -> {
    for (Row row : rows) {
      System.out.println(row.getString("FIRST_NAME"));
    }
  });
----

=== Running queries on managed connections

The following example shows how to run queries on managed connections in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
pool
  .getConnection()
  .onFailure(e -> {
    // Failed to get a connection
  })
  .onSuccess(conn -> {
    conn
      .query("SELECT * FROM user")
      .execute()
      .onFailure(e -> {
        // Handle the failure
        // Important, do not forget to return the connection
        conn.close();
      })
      .onSuccess(rows -> {
        for (Row row : rows) {
          System.out.println(row.getString("FIRST_NAME"));
        }
        // Important, do not forget to return the connection
        conn.close();
      });
  });
----

== Support for stored procedures

Stored procedures are supported in the JDBC client.

The following example shows how to pass `IN` arguments in {VertX} {v3x}.

[source,java]
----
// 3.x
connection.callWithParams(
  "{ call new_customer(?, ?) }",
  new JsonArray().add("John").add("Doe"),
  null,
  res -> {
    if (res.succeeded()) {
      // Success!
    } else {
      // Failed!
    }
  });
----

The following example shows how to pass `IN` arguments in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
// 4.0
client
  .preparedQuery("{call new_customer(?, ?)}")
  .execute(Tuple.of("Paulo", "Lopes"))
  .onSuccess(rows -> {
    ...
  });
----

In {VertX} {v3x}, the support for combining  the `IN` and `OUT` arguments was very limited due to the available types. In {VertX} {v4}, the pool is type safe and can handle the combination of `IN` and `OUT` arguments. You can also use `INOUT` parameters in your applications.

The following example shows handling of arguments in {VertX} {v3x}.

[source,java]
----
// 3.x
connection.callWithParams(
  "{ call customer_lastname(?, ?) }",
  new JsonArray().add("John"),
  new JsonArray().addNull().add("VARCHAR"),
  res -> {
    if (res.succeeded()) {
      ResultSet result = res.result();
    } else {
      // Failed!
    }
});
----

The following example shows handling of arguments in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java]
----
// 4.x
client
  .preparedQuery("{call customer_lastname(?, ?)}")
  .execute(Tuple.of("John", SqlOutParam.OUT(JDBCType.VARCHAR)))
  .onSuccess(rows -> {
    ...
  });
----

In the JDBC client, the data types have been updated.

* For an argument of type `OUT`, you can specify its return type. In the example, the `OUT` argument is specified as type `VARCHAR` which is a JDBC constant.

* The types are not bound by JSON limitations. You can now use database specific types instead of text constants for the type name.

== Legacy JDBC Client API and MySQL Connector/J

If you are planning on continuing to use the {VertX} {v3x} APIs and are using MySQL Connector/J, you need to do some additional migration work.

{VertX} {v4} uses parameter metadata produced by the JDBC driver to determine how to encode JSON primitives to Java for prepared statements. MySQL Connector/J does not automatically generate parameter metadata for prepared statements.

It's possible to enable this feature in MySQL Connector/J by adding `generateSimpleParameterMetadata=true` to connection string:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject jsonConfig = new JsonObject()
   .put(/* other options */)
   .put("url", "jdbc:mysql://<host>/<database>?generateSimpleParameterMetadata=true");

SQLClient client = JDBCClient.create(vertx, jsonConfig);
----

Unfortunately the support for parameter metadata in MySQL Connector/J is (as the name implies) quite rudimentary. Most notably, you might face issues with datetime/date/time related values. A workaround for these is to implement a custom `JDBCEncoder` (inheriting from `io.vertx.ext.jdbc.spi.impl.JDBCEncoderImpl`).

You might also face similar issues when querying rows. {VertX} {v3} APIs return rows as `JsonObject`s, and some data types from the new decoder can't be converted to JSON primitives. A workaround for these is to implement a custom `JDBCDecoder` (inhering from `io.vertx.ext.jdbc.spi.impl.JDBCDecoderImpl`).

To configure the custom encoder and decoder, you need to add `encoderCls` and `decoderCls` options in the `jsonConfig`:

[source,java]
----
JsonObject jsonConfig = new JsonObject()
   .put(/* other options */)
   .put("encoderCls", "com.mysite.CustomJDBCEncoder")
   .put("decoderCls", "com.mysite.CustomJDBCDecoder");

SQLClient client = JDBCClient.create(vertx, jsonConfig);
