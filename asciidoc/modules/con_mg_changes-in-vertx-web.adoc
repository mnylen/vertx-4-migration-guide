= Changes in {VertX} web

The following section describes the changes in {VertX} web.

== Combined the functionality of user session handler in session handler

In earlier releases of {VertX}, you had to specify both the `UserSessionHandler` and `SessionHandler` handlers when working in a session.

To simplify the process, in {VertX} {v4}, the `UserSessionHandler` class has been removed and its functionality has been added in the `SessionHandler` class. In {VertX} {v4}, to work with sessions you must specify only one handler.

== Removed the cookie interfaces

The following cookie interfaces have been removed:

* `io.vertx.ext.web.Cookie`
* `io.vertx.ext.web.handler.CookieHandler`

Use the `io.vertx.core.http.Cookie` interface instead.

== Favicon and error handlers use `Vertx` file system

The create methods in `FaviconHandler` and `ErrorHandler` have been updated. You must pass a `Vertx` instance object in the create methods. These methods access file system. Passing the `Vertx` object ensures consistent access to files using the 'Vertx' file system.

The following example shows how create methods were used in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
FaviconHandler.create();
ErrorHandler.create();
----

The following example shows how create methods should be used in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
FaviconHandler.create(vertx);
ErrorHandler.create(vertx);
----

== Accessing the template engine

Use the method `TemplateEngine.unwrap()` to access the template engine. You can then apply customizations and configurations to the template.

The following methods that are used to get and set the engine configurations have been deprecated. Use the `TemplateEngine.unwrap()` method instead.

* `HandlebarsTemplateEngine.getHandlebars()`
* `HandlebarsTemplateEngine.getResolvers()`
* `HandlebarsTemplateEngine.setResolvers()`
* `JadeTemplateEngine.getJadeConfiguration()`
* `ThymeleafTemplateEngine.getThymeleafTemplateEngine()`
* `ThymeleafTemplateEngine.setMode()`

== Removed the locale interface

The `io.vertx.ext.web.Locale` interface has been removed. Use the `io.vertx.ext.web.LanguageHeader` interface instead.

== Removed the acceptable locales method

The `RoutingContext.acceptableLocales()` method has been removed. Use the `RoutingContext.acceptableLanguages()` method instead.

== Updated the method for mounting sub routers

In earlier releases of {VertX}, the `Router.mountSubRouter()` method incorrectly returned a `Router`. This has been fixed, and the method now returns a `Route`.

== Removed the create method with excluded strings for JWT authentication handling

The `JWTAuthHandler.create(JWTAuth authProvider, String skip)` method has been removed. Use the `JWTAuthHandler.create(JWTAuth authProvider)` method instead.

The following example shows how JWT authentication handler was created in {VertX} {v3x} releases.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
router
   // protect everything but "/excluded/path"
   .route().handler(JWTAuthHandler(jwtAuth, "/excluded/path")
----

The following example shows how JWT authentication handler was created in {VertX} {v4}.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
router
   .route("/excluded/path").handler(/* public access to "/excluded/path" */)
   // protect everything
   .route().handler(JWTAuthHandler(jwtAuth)
----

== Removed the create handler method that was used in OSGi environments

In {VertX} {v4}, OSGi environment is no longer supported. The `StaticHandler.create(String, ClassLoader)` method has been removed because the method was used in the OSGi environment.

If you have used this method in your applications, then in {VertX} {v4} you can either add the resources to the application classpath or serve resources from the file system.

== Removed the bridge options class

The `sockjs.BridgeOptions` class has been removed. Use the new `sockjs.SockJSBridgeOptions` class instead. The `sockjs.SockJSBridgeOptions` class contains all the options that are required to configure the event bus bridge.

There is no change in the behavior of the new class, except that the name of the data object class has changed.

In previous releases, when you used `sockjs.BridgeOptions` class to add new bridges, there were a lot of duplicate configurations. The new class contains all the possible common configurations, and removes duplicate configurations.

== SockJS socket event bus does not register a clustered event by default

`SockJSSocket` no longer registers a clustered event bus consumer by default. If you want to write to the socket using the event bus, you must enable the `writeHandler` in `SockJSHandlerOptions`. When you enable the `writeHandler`, the event bus consumer is set to local by default.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
Router router = Router.router(vertx);
SockJSHandlerOptions options = new SockJSHandlerOptions()
  .setRegisterWriteHandler(true); // enable the event bus consumer registration
SockJSHandler sockJSHandler = SockJSHandler.create(vertx, options);
router.mountSubRouter("/myapp", sockJSHandler.socketHandler(sockJSSocket -> {
  // Retrieve the writeHandlerID and store it (For example, in a local map)
  String writeHandlerID = sockJSSocket.writeHandlerID();
}));
----

You can configure the event bus consumer to a cluster.

[source,java,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
SockJSHandlerOptions options = new SockJSHandlerOptions()
  .setRegisterWriteHandler(true) // enable the event bus consumer registration
  .setLocalWriteHandler(false) // register a clustered event bus consumer
----

== New method for adding authentication provider

The `SessionHandler.setAuthProvider(AuthProvider)` method has been deprecated. Use the `SessionHandler.addAuthProvider()` method instead. The new method allows an application to work with multiple authentication providers and link the session objects to these authentication providers.

== OAuth2 authentication provider create methods require `vertx` as constructor argument

From {VertX} {v4}, `OAuth2Auth.create(Vertx vertx)` method requires `vertx` as a constructor argument. The `vertx` argument uses a secure non-blocking random number generator to generate nonce which ensures better security for applications.

== WebClient HttpRequest does not accept empty username for basic authentication anymore

In {VertX} {v4} calling `HttpRequest#basicAuthentication(String username, String password)` with empty username will result in error. If the service you are calling expects empty username, you can work around this by crafting the basic auth header yourself:

[source,java]
----
WebClient client = WebClient.create(vertx);

String basicAuthCredentials = ":" + password;
String basicAuthHeader = "Basic " + Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(basicAuthCredentials.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF-8));

client.postAbs(url)
  .putHeader("Authorization", basicAuthHeader)
----
